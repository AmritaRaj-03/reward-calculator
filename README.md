# Reward Calculator

## Project Overview
This project is a **Reward Calculator** built in Java with Spring Boot. It awards reward points to customers based on their purchases over a specified time period. 
The main goal is to allow easy tracking and calculation of rewards, with data stored in MySQL and accessible through a simple API.

---

## Introduction
- **Project Overview**: The Reward Calculator API enables to record customer transactions and calculate rewards based on a points system. Customers earn points for each purchase, which helps increase customer engagement and loyalty.
- **Motivation**: This project was created to demonstrate backend calculation logic for rewards, handling database operations, and providing a clean API with error handling for seamless integration with front-end applications.

## Design Details

### Architecture
This project is built using Spring Boot. The application is structured into different layers to handle services, repository interactions, and REST API endpoints within a single service.

### Data Flow
1. **Transaction Recording**: Customer transactions are stored in the database via the `TransactionRepository`.
2. **Reward Calculation**: The `CustomerService` calculates rewards based on a customerâ€™s transactions over a specified period.
3. **API Interaction**: Users interact with the API through `CustomerController`, which routes requests to the service layer.

### Core Components
- **Controller Layer**: `CustomerController` handles incoming API requests and directs them to the service layer.
- **Service Layer**: The `CustomerService` and `CustomerServiceImpl` classes contain business logic, including reward calculations.
- **Repository Layer**: Interfaces with the database through `CustomerRepository` and `TransactionRepository`.

### Database Schema
The database includes two main tables:
- **Customer Table**: Stores customer information.
- **Transaction Table**: Records each transaction and links to the `Customer` table with a foreign key.
